When running code through the IDE, I am beginning to see that my problem is not the content itself- but rather the verbage. I understand the processes and the associated methods, and how to manipulate- I just need to get the use of verbage as it applies to the lessons. 

Pracitce makes perfect, so I'm beginning to hunker down and focus more now that I know my weakness when it comes to homeowork.
