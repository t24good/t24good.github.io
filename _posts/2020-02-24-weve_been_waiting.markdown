Well. Here we are. 

Here I am.

Me.
My dreams.
My future.
My procrastination.
My to do lists.
My lacking ambition.
My... drive?

Except now I've hit a coding wall, and I am so very frustrated. I question the decision I've made to become fluent in software engineering. And now? Now I've got this dreadful "leaning blaock". Will I ever get over this hump, or is this a sign? A sign that needed to become more clear and coherent to.... myself?


Myself. And all of these possibilities, and they're all singing in cadence to my learning block,

***"We've been waaiiiting..."***
