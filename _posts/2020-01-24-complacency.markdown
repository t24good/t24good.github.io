Word of the Year: Complacency. 

I had simply become complacent in my life's journey. I held a job for 10+ years, and I couldn't see myself developing within the company any further. So what was I to do?

I had been to college, and picked up a couple of "dust collecting" degrees, and I had tenure at a huge company with no chance of moving forward professionally in the forseeable future. Granted, I was making decent money- but I was working 12+ hour daily shifts, with no acknowledgement, with absolutely no work/life balance, and with no future.

I was so unhappy and stressed that my other half insisted that I quit my job, and take time to find what I really wanted to do in life. So after saving, and stressing for a few months- I FINALLY DID IT! I QUIT MY JOB OF TEN YEARS... and I... I had no earthly idea of what was next for me.... Welllll.... CRAP.

I began researching online into careers that would ultimately feel as unfullfilling as my last one- and then I stumbled upon a boot camp for software engineering. The more I read and researched, I was more and more entrigued and estatic about the possibilities. 

You see, I've always been a problem solver. From fixing things with my hands, to computer problems that just didnt make sense, to finding work-arounds to almost anything that just didnt cross all the T's and dot all the I's. I was a perfectionist. I want everything to work, and I want it to work efficiently, and effectively. I was a human work-around maker person. (Yes... I just made that up) and I had just found a potential career path that capitalized on diligent problem-solving.

While I found a job, and I am content with the everyday operations- I still wanted to do something interested ME. So I completed the boot camp. And as confusing and frustraing it was for me, it was so rewarding! 

So now I'm here, I'm into my first official week of Software Engineering- and I am intimidated out of my mind.

Here goes nothing!... and something
